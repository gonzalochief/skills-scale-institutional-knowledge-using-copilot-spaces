# Project Management Docs (OctoAcme)

This folder contains project management process documents, templates, and checklists to help teams run predictable projects for OctoAcme.

Included in this change:
- octoacme-roles-and-personas.md — Adds new personas (Release Manager, Risk Coordinator, Communications Lead, Data Analyst, Stakeholder Liaison) and clarifies interactions with existing roles.
- octoacme-release-checklist.md — Practical pre-release checklist and go/no-go guidance.
- octoacme-risk-register-template.md — Risk register template, how-to, and escalation guidance.
- octoacme-communication-plan-template.md — Communication plan template and approval flow.

Why these changes
